# RideSharing-CapstoneProject
RideSharing is a mobile car sharing application. Carpooling refers to a mode of transportation in which individual travelers share a vehicle for the trip. The application was written by a group of 3 people, including me, using Flutter for Frontend and Google Firebase for Backend.
