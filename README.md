# RideSharing-CapstoneProject

RideSharing is a mobile car-sharing application designed for carpooling, where individual travelers share a vehicle for a trip. The application was developed by a team of 3 people, including myself, using Dart with the Flutter framework for the frontend and Google Firebase for the backend. This project aims to provide an efficient and eco-friendly transportation solution for users.
